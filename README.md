# Raspberry Pi Pico Bare Metal 

Follow along and get your own raspberry pi pico running from the ground up. Each section builds up on itself and after the first 3 labs in the programs directory 
you have enough for a mini library. Eventually you can build out your own SDK and OS that runs on the pico.

Inside the docs folder I've placed both the official rp2040 datasheet and the Pi foundations SDK manual. The SDK manual has lots of examples about how things should
work at a high level. This can be helpful for starting but eventually you will have to crack open the rp2040 datasheet. This datasheet has a lot of information and usually
the things you will need can be spread across a 100 pages. So have CMD+F ready!

This project was inspired by Engler's 140E course and DWelch67's bare metal repository for the pico. I've included links for both repos at the bottom of this page
and have made sure to cite any pages from both repo's.
